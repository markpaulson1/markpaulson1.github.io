<div class="bio">
		I have been an art director/creative director for the last 20 years, and I decided to come to GA to get some training in programming and coding to round out my experiences and to help move me into a new career in digital creation. I would love to find a position after completing GA that would utilize the skills I have learned, but also move me into something new. That said, I think my spirit animal of the moment would be the chameleon, but I feel its time to change colors and adapt to a new environment.
